  <ul>
    <li>Watamu Islands</li>
      <p>The smooth white beach of Watamu, which slides gently into shallow, turquoise water, forms part of the Malindi Marine Reserve Park, a marine protected area. The snorkeling and diving around the offshore coral formations is said to be the best in East Africa.</p>

    <li>Maasai Mara</li>
      <p>To call the Masai Mara stunning is an understatement. Vast open space, carpets of green and an abundance of wildlife where some animals seem downright exotic. There is a deep sense of comfort I feel when I spend hours in a jeep driving through forests and this time there are no restrictions for time or where you can go, no rules that need to be followed in terms of where you can wander. Just the open road and some excellent trackers to ensure you get a glimpse of what the Mara has to offer.  To begin with it is impossible to expect that you will cover the entire bush.</p>
